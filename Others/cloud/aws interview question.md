### General and Foundational Concepts

*   **What is AWS?**
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services on demand, such as computing power, database storage, and content delivery. Its popularity stems from its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and extensive global infrastructure.
*   **What are the three main cloud service models?**
    The three main models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources like virtual machines (EC2), storage (S3), and networking (VPC). PaaS offers development and deployment tools, such as AWS Lambda and Elastic Beanstalk. SaaS delivers pre-built applications, like Salesforce running on AWS.
*   **What is the difference between an Availability Zone and a Region?**
    An AWS Region is a geographical area, while an Availability Zone consists of one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity within a Region.

### Compute

*   **What is Amazon EC2?**
    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a service that provides scalable virtual servers, known as instances, in the AWS cloud. It's used for a variety of workloads, including hosting websites, running applications, and processing batch jobs.
*   **What are the different types of EC2 instances?**
    There are several types of EC2 instances optimized for different use cases, including General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, and Accelerated Computing instances.
*   **What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?**
    Stopping an instance is like shutting down a physical server; the attached EBS volumes remain, and you can restart it later. Terminating an instance is a permanent deletion of the instance and its attached EBS volumes.
*   **What is AWS Lambda?**
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. This allows you to build applications and services without the need to provision or manage servers.

### Storage

*   **What is Amazon S3?**
    Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It can be used to store and protect any amount of data for a wide range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, and big data analytics.
*   **What are the different storage classes in Amazon S3?**
    Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases, including S3 Standard for general-purpose storage, S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns, S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for less frequently accessed data, and Amazon Glacier for long-term archive.
*   **Can S3 be used with EC2 instances? If so, how?**
    Yes, S3 can be used with EC2 instances. You can use S3 to store files and data that your EC2 instances will process. For example, you can mount an S3 bucket to an EC2 instance or use the AWS SDK or CLI to access data in S3 from your application running on EC2.

### Networking

*   **What is a VPC?**
    An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It gives you control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
*   **What is the difference between a security group and a network ACL?**
    Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
*   **What is Amazon Route 53?**
    Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses a reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating human-readable names, like `www.example.com`, into the numeric IP addresses, like `192.0.2.1`, that computers use to connect to each other.

### Databases

*   **What is the difference between Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and Redshift?**
    *   **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
    *   **Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
    *   **Amazon Redshift** is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud.
*   **When would you choose Amazon RDS over DynamoDB?**
    You would choose RDS when your application requires a relational database with complex queries and transactions, such as a traditional e-commerce or CRM application. DynamoDB is a better fit for applications that need a flexible data model and low-latency read and write access, like mobile apps, gaming, and IoT.

### Security and Identity

*   **What is AWS IAM?**
    AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.
*   **What are some security best practices for AWS?**
    Some best practices include implementing the principle of least privilege using IAM policies, encrypting data at rest and in transit using services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS), using security groups to control network traffic, and conducting regular security audits.

### Scenario-Based Questions

*   **How would you design a fault-tolerant and highly available architecture on AWS?**
    This would involve using multiple Availability Zones, an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic, Auto Scaling to adjust capacity, and durable data storage with services like Amazon S3 and RDS with multi-AZ deployments.
*   **How would you optimize the cost of an AWS architecture?**
    Strategies include using the right instance types for the workload, leveraging Reserved Instances or Spot Instances for predictable or flexible workloads, using Auto Scaling to match capacity with demand, and implementing S3 lifecycle policies to move data to more cost-effective storage tiers.
*   **You have an application that experiences sudden, unpredictable traffic spikes. How would you design the architecture to handle this?**
    A common approach is to use Auto Scaling to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on demand. You could also use serverless components like AWS Lambda and API Gateway, which scale automatically. An Elastic Load Balancer would distribute the incoming traffic across the instances.
