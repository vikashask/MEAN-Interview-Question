🔹 Phase 1: Fundamentals of JavaScript & Modern ES6+ (1–2 weeks)

Even with experience, revisiting modern JS ensures smoother React development.
	•	Scope, Hoisting, Closures, this
		- Understand function and block scope, including var vs let/const differences
		- Hoisting of variables and functions: declarations are moved to the top of their scope
		- Lexical scoping and closure behavior: functions remember the environment where they were created
		- Context of 'this' in functions, arrow functions, and objects: how 'this' is bound differently
	•	ES6+ Features: let/const, Arrow Functions, Destructuring, Spread/Rest, Template Literals
		- Use let/const for block-scoped variables to avoid hoisting issues
		- Arrow functions for concise syntax and lexical 'this' binding
		- Destructuring to extract values from arrays/objects easily
		- Spread/rest operators for copying and combining arrays/objects and handling function arguments
		- Template literals for multi-line strings and embedding expressions
	•	Modules & Imports
		- Understand ES6 module syntax: export/import
		- Default vs named exports and how to import them
		- Benefits of modular code for maintainability and reusability
	•	Promises, async/await, fetch API
		- Promises represent asynchronous operations and their states
		- async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code
		- Fetch API for making HTTP requests and handling responses
		- Error handling with try/catch in async functions
	•	Array methods: map, filter, reduce, find
		- map: transform each element in an array
		- filter: select elements based on a condition
		- reduce: accumulate values into a single result
		- find: locate the first element matching a condition
		- Use cases and chaining these methods for data manipulation

🔹 Phase 2: Core React (2–3 weeks)

Learn the core concepts to build basic React applications.
	•	JSX & Rendering
		- JSX is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`
		- Must return a single root element per component
		- Use curly braces {} to embed JavaScript expressions in JSX
		- JSX compiles to React.createElement calls under the hood
	•	Functional vs Class Components (focus more on Functional)
		- Functional components are simpler and use hooks for state and lifecycle
		- Class components use `this` and lifecycle methods but are less recommended now
		- Prefer functional components for cleaner and more maintainable code
	•	Props & State
		- Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components
		- State is internal and mutable data managed within a component
		- Use useState hook to add state to functional components
		- Avoid directly mutating state; use setter functions instead
	•	Event Handling
		- Handle events using camelCase syntax (e.g., onClick)
		- Pass event handlers as functions, not strings
		- Use event.preventDefault() to control default browser behavior
		- Remember to bind event handlers or use arrow functions in class components
	•	Conditional Rendering
		- Render elements based on conditions using ternary operators or logical && 
		- Avoid unnecessary rendering for performance optimization
		- Use short-circuit evaluation for concise conditional rendering
	•	Lists & Keys
		- Render lists using Array.map()
		- Provide unique keys to each list item for efficient reconciliation
		- Avoid using array index as key if list order can change
	•	Lifting State Up
		- Move shared state to the closest common ancestor to share data between components
		- Pass state and setters down via props to child components
		- Helps keep components in sync and promotes single source of truth
	•	Forms & Controlled Components
		- Controlled components have form inputs bound to React state
		- Update state on input changes to keep React in control
		- Validate inputs and handle form submission within React handlers

🔹 Phase 3: React Hooks & Component Architecture (3–4 weeks)

Hooks are the backbone of modern React development.
	•	useState, useEffect
		- useState manages local state in functional components
		- useEffect handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions
		- Understand dependency arrays to control when effects run
		- Clean up effects to avoid memory leaks
	•	useRef, useContext, useReducer
		- useRef stores mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders
		- useContext provides a way to pass data deeply without prop drilling
		- useReducer manages complex state logic with reducer functions, similar to Redux
	•	Custom Hooks
		- Reusable functions that encapsulate hook logic
		- Share stateful logic between components without duplication
		- Follow naming convention `useSomething`
	•	Component Design Principles
		- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
		- Use composition over inheritance
		- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components or values
	•	Smart vs Dumb Components
		- Smart components handle data fetching and state management
		- Dumb components focus on UI presentation and receive data via props
		- Separation improves maintainability and testability
	•	Folder Structure Best Practices
		- Organize by feature or domain rather than file type
		- Group related components, hooks, and utilities together
		- Use clear naming conventions for easier navigation

🔹 Phase 4: Routing & State Management (3–4 weeks)

Integrate real-world complexity into your apps.
	•	React Router (v6): Routing, Nested Routes, Navigation, Params
		- Define routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components
		- Use `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation
		- Access URL parameters with `useParams`
		- Implement nested routing to create layouts and sub-pages
		- Handle 404 pages with wildcard routes
	•	State Management:
		- Local state (useState/useReducer)
			- Manage component-specific state easily
			- useReducer helps with complex state logic and actions
		- Global state (Context API or Redux)
			- Context API shares state across components without prop drilling
			- Redux offers a predictable state container with middleware support
		- Comparison of Redux Toolkit vs Zustand/MobX (optional)
			- Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup with less boilerplate
			- Zustand and MobX provide simpler and more flexible alternatives
			- Choose based on project complexity and team familiarity

🔹 Phase 5: API Integration & Side Effects (2–3 weeks)

Make your apps data-driven and interactive.
	•	Fetching Data using fetch / axios

		- Cancel requests when components unmount to avoid memory leaks
	•	Handling Loading and Error States
		- Show loading indicators while fetching data
		- Display user-friendly error messages on failures
		- Update UI based on fetch status to improve UX
	•	Using async/await with useEffect
		- Wrap async logic inside useEffect since effect callbacks cannot be async
		- Handle cleanup and dependencies carefully to avoid stale data
	•	Pagination, Infinite Scroll
		- Implement pagination to load data in chunks for performance
		- Use infinite scroll to load more data as the user scrolls
		- Manage state to track current page and loading status

Improve performance and code maintainability.
	•	Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
		- Split code into chunks to reduce initial load time
		- Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components on demand
		- Improves app performance especially for large apps
	•	Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
		- React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of components
		- useMemo memoizes expensive calculations between renders
		- useCallback memoizes function references to prevent child re-renders
		- Use these tools judiciously to optimize performance without complexity
	•	Error Boundaries
		- Catch JavaScript errors in component tree to prevent app crashes
		- Display fallback UI when errors occur
		- Only class components can be error boundaries currently
	•	Performance Profiling
		- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components
		- Analyze rendering times and re-render causes
		- Optimize based on profiling insights
	•	Testing:
		- Unit testing with Jest + React Testing Library
			- Write tests for individual components and logic
			- Use React Testing Library for testing UI behavior over implementation details
		- Component testing best practices
			- Test user interactions, props, and state changes
			- Avoid testing internal implementation details for maintainability
