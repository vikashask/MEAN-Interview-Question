# React Road Map

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Fundamentals of JavaScript & Modern ES6+ (1â€“2 weeks)

Even with experience, revisiting modern JS ensures smoother React development.

### Scope, Hoisting, Closures, this
- Understand function and block scope, including var vs let/const differences
- Hoisting of variables and functions: declarations are moved to the top of their scope
- Lexical scoping and closure behavior: functions remember the environment where they were created
- Context of 'this' in functions, arrow functions, and objects: how 'this' is bound differently

### ES6+ Features: let/const, Arrow Functions, Destructuring, Spread/Rest, Template Literals
- Use let/const for block-scoped variables to avoid hoisting issues
- Arrow functions for concise syntax and lexical 'this' binding
- Destructuring to extract values from arrays/objects easily
- Spread/rest operators for copying and combining arrays/objects and handling function arguments
- Template literals for multi-line strings and embedding expressions

### Modules & Imports
- Understand ES6 module syntax: export/import
- Default vs named exports and how to import them
- Benefits of modular code for maintainability and reusability

### Promises, async/await, fetch API
- Promises represent asynchronous operations and their states
- async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests and handling responses
- Error handling with try/catch in async functions

### Array methods: map, filter, reduce, find
- map: transform each element in an array
- filter: select elements based on a condition
- reduce: accumulate values into a single result
- find: locate the first element matching a condition
- Use cases and chaining these methods for data manipulation

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Core React (2â€“3 weeks)

Learn the core concepts to build basic React applications.

### JSX & Rendering
- JSX is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`
- Must return a single root element per component
- Use curly braces {} to embed JavaScript expressions in JSX
- JSX compiles to React.createElement calls under the hood

### Functional vs Class Components
- Functional components are simpler and use hooks for state and lifecycle
- Class components use `this` and lifecycle methods but are less recommended now
- Prefer functional components for cleaner and more maintainable code

### Props & State
- Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components
- State is internal and mutable data managed within a component
- Use useState hook to add state to functional components
- Avoid directly mutating state; use setter functions instead

### Event Handling
- Handle events using camelCase syntax (e.g., onClick)
- Pass event handlers as functions, not strings
- Use event.preventDefault() to control default browser behavior
- Remember to bind event handlers or use arrow functions in class components

### Conditional Rendering
- Render elements based on conditions using ternary operators or logical && 
- Avoid unnecessary rendering for performance optimization
- Use short-circuit evaluation for concise conditional rendering

### Lists & Keys
- Render lists using Array.map()
- Provide unique keys to each list item for efficient reconciliation
- Avoid using array index as key if list order can change

### Lifting State Up
- Move shared state to the closest common ancestor to share data between components
- Pass state and setters down via props to child components
- Helps keep components in sync and promotes single source of truth

### Forms & Controlled Components
- Controlled components have form inputs bound to React state
- Update state on input changes to keep React in control
- Validate inputs and handle form submission within React handlers

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: React Hooks & Component Architecture (3â€“4 weeks)

Hooks are the backbone of modern React development.

### useState, useEffect
- useState manages local state in functional components
- useEffect handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions
- Understand dependency arrays to control when effects run
- Clean up effects to avoid memory leaks

### useRef, useContext, useReducer
- useRef stores mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders
- useContext provides a way to pass data deeply without prop drilling
- useReducer manages complex state logic with reducer functions, similar to Redux

### Custom Hooks
- Reusable functions that encapsulate hook logic
- Share stateful logic between components without duplication
- Follow naming convention `useSomething`

### Component Design Principles
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components or values

### Smart vs Dumb Components
- Smart components handle data fetching and state management
- Dumb components focus on UI presentation and receive data via props
- Separation improves maintainability and testability

### Folder Structure Best Practices
- Organize by feature or domain rather than file type
- Group related components, hooks, and utilities together
- Use clear naming conventions for easier navigation

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Routing & State Management (3â€“4 weeks)

Integrate real-world complexity into your apps.

### React Router (v6)
- Define routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components
- Use `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation
- Access URL parameters with `useParams`
- Implement nested routing to create layouts and sub-pages
- Handle 404 pages with wildcard routes

### State Management
#### Local state (useState/useReducer)
- Manage component-specific state easily
- useReducer helps with complex state logic and actions

#### Global state (Context API or Redux)
- Context API shares state across components without prop drilling
- Redux offers a predictable state container with middleware support

#### Comparison of Redux Toolkit vs Zustand/MobX (optional)
- Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup with less boilerplate
- Zustand and MobX provide simpler and more flexible alternatives
- Choose based on project complexity and team familiarity

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: API Integration & Side Effects (2â€“3 weeks)

Make your apps data-driven and interactive.

### Fetching Data using fetch / axios
- Use fetch for native HTTP requests; axios for easier syntax and features
- Handle response parsing and error checking properly
- Cancel requests when components unmount to avoid memory leaks

### Handling Loading and Error States
- Show loading indicators while fetching data
- Display user-friendly error messages on failures
- Update UI based on fetch status to improve UX

### Using async/await with useEffect
- Wrap async logic inside useEffect since effect callbacks cannot be async
- Handle cleanup and dependencies carefully to avoid stale data

### Pagination, Infinite Scroll
- Implement pagination to load data in chunks for performance
- Use infinite scroll to load more data as the user scrolls
- Manage state to track current page and loading status

### React Query (TanStack Query)

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Split code into chunks to reduce initial load time
- Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components on demand
- Improves app performance especially for large apps

### Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of components
- useMemo memoizes expensive calculations between renders
- useCallback memoizes function references to prevent child re-renders
- Use these tools judiciously to optimize performance without complexity

### Error Boundaries
- Catch JavaScript errors in component tree to prevent app crashes
- Display fallback UI when errors occur
- Only class components can be error boundaries currently

### Performance Profiling
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components
- Analyze rendering times and re-render causes
- Optimize based on profiling insights

### Testing
#### Unit testing with Jest + React Testing Library
- Write tests for individual components and logic
- Use React Testing Library for testing UI behavior over implementation details

#### Component testing best practices
- Test user interactions, props, and state changes
- Avoid testing internal implementation details for maintainability
