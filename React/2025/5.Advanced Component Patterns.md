> Question: Explain the Render Props pattern and compare it to Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Hooks.
Hint: Discuss code reuse patterns, pros/cons (e.g., HOC prop pollution vs. render props explicitness), and how hooks often replace these patterns.

> Question: What is the Compound Component Pattern? Provide an example of it in React.
Hint: Show how components share state implicitly (e.g., <Tabs> and <Tab> components) and how to implement it using React.Children or context.

> Question: How would you implement a reusable ErrorBoundary component? Provide a code example.
Hint: Use componentDidCatch or the newer static getDerivedStateFromError to handle errors and display a fallback UI.
