# React Reconciliation

## ‚öõÔ∏è What is React Reconciliation?

**Reconciliation** is the process React uses to **compare** the current DOM (or Virtual DOM) with the new Virtual DOM and **efficiently update** the UI.

> It‚Äôs how React figures out **what has changed**, and then **updates only those parts** of the DOM ‚Äî instead of re-rendering everything.

## üß† Why is Reconciliation Needed?

React apps are often composed of many components. When the state or props of a component change, React needs to:

1. Render a new Virtual DOM based on the new state/props.
2. Compare the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.
3. Find the **minimal set of changes**.
4. Update the actual DOM accordingly (which is slower compared to updating Virtual DOM).

This process is called **reconciliation**.

## üîç How Reconciliation Works

React uses a **Virtual DOM**, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM, to do this efficiently.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Render Phase**: React builds a new Virtual DOM tree based on the new state/props.
2. **Diffing**: React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (this is the core of reconciliation).
3. **Patching**: React finds out the changes and updates the real DOM accordingly.

## üßÆ React's Diffing Algorithm

React makes some **assumptions** to make the diffing fast:

1. **Different element types** mean different trees.
   - `<div>` vs `<span>` ‚Üí React will throw away the old one and create a new one.
2. **Keys help identify elements** uniquely in lists.
   - This helps React know which items changed, moved, or were removed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Importance of `key` in Reconciliation

When rendering lists (like with `.map()`), React **relies on keys** to track elements across renders.

Bad:

```jsx
items.map((item) => <li>{item.name}</li>);
```

Good:

```jsx
items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
```

Without proper keys, React may re-render unnecessarily or cause bugs in UI.

## üß™ Real-Life Example

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times</button>
  );
}
```

Each time `count` changes:

- React creates a new Virtual DOM with the updated text.
- Compares it to the previous Virtual DOM.
- Sees only the text inside `<button>` changed.
- Updates just that part in the actual DOM.

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Reconciliation** is React‚Äôs internal process of updating the UI efficiently.
- It uses a **diffing algorithm** to compare new and old Virtual DOMs.
- The goal is to **minimize DOM changes** (because DOM operations are slow).
- **Keys** are crucial for correctly identifying elements in lists.
