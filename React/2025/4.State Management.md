> Question: Compare different state management solutions in React (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Recoil, Context API). When would you choose one over another?
Hint: Discuss trade-offs like complexity, scalability, and use cases (e.g., Context for small-scale global state, Redux for large apps with complex Question:

> Question: How would you implement a global state using the Context API and useReducer? Provide a code example.
Hint: Show a context with a reducer to manage state updates, including dispatching actions and consuming the context in components.

> Question: What are the potential pitfalls of using the Context API for state management?
Hint: Discuss performance issues (re-renders of consumers on context changes) and solutions like splitting contexts or using selectors.
