> Question: Compare different state management solutions in React (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Recoil, Context API). When would you choose one over another?

**Answer:**

1. **Redux**:

   - Mature ecosystem with extensive middleware support
   - Predictable state management with a single store
   - Best for large applications with complex state
   - Choose when you need time-travel debugging, middleware ecosystem, and strict state update patterns

2. **Zustand**:

   - Lightweight alternative to Redux (much smaller bundle size)
   - Simple API with minimal boilerplate
   - No providers needed, uses hooks pattern
   - Choose when you need Redux-like functionality with less overhead and simpler setup

3. **Recoil**:

   - Built specifically for React by Facebook
   - Atom-based approach for granular state updates
   - Excellent for state that updates frequently and needs to avoid re-renders
   - Choose when dealing with complex, interdependent states with minimal re-renders

4. **Context API**:
   - Built into React, no additional dependencies
   - Simple to implement for basic global state
   - Choose for simpler applications or component trees where props drilling is the main issue
   - Not optimized for frequent updates due to re-render behavior

Choose Redux for large, complex applications with many state interactions; Zustand for medium-sized apps seeking simplicity; Recoil for apps with complex state dependencies; Context API for smaller apps or when you want to avoid external dependencies.

> Question: How would you implement a global state using the Context API and useReducer? Provide a code example.

**Answer:**

Here's a simple implementation using Context API with useReducer:

```jsx
// 1. Create the context
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from "react";

// 2. Define initial state and reducer
const initialState = {
  count: 0,
  user: null,
};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    case "SET_USER":
      return { ...state, user: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// 3. Create the context
const StateContext = createContext();

// 4. Create a provider component
export function StateProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <StateContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </StateContext.Provider>
  );
}

// 5. Create a custom hook for using the context
export function useStateValue() {
  return useContext(StateContext);
}

// 6. Usage in your app
// In App.js:
function App() {
  return (
    <StateProvider>
      <div className="App">
        <Counter />
        <UserProfile />
      </div>
    </StateProvider>
  );
}

// In a component:
function Counter() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useStateValue();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This pattern creates a global state that any component can access and modify through dispatched actions, without prop drilling.

> Question: What are the potential pitfalls of using the Context API for state management?

**Answer:**

1. **Performance issues with frequent updates**:

   - When context value changes, all components that consume the context will re-render, even if they only use a portion of the data
   - Can lead to unnecessary re-renders in large component trees

2. **Lack of middleware support**:

   - No built-in way to handle side effects, unlike Redux middleware
   - Requires additional patterns for async operations

3. **Increased complexity with multiple contexts**:

   - Managing multiple contexts can lead to provider nesting ("provider hell")
   - Difficult to manage interactions between different contexts

4. **Debugging challenges**:

   - No built-in dev tools like Redux DevTools
   - Harder to track state changes and debug issues

5. **Lack of centralized store structure**:

   - No enforced structure for organizing complex state
   - Can become messy in larger applications without disciplined patterns

6. **Potential for prop drilling of dispatch functions**:
   - While state is global, sometimes dispatch functions still need to be passed down

Best practices to mitigate these issues include splitting contexts by domain, using memoization, and implementing custom hooks for specific state slices.
