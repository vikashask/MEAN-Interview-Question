> Question: How would you test a React component that uses hooks and interacts with an API? Provide an example using a testing library like React Testing Library.
Hint: Show how to mock API calls, test rendering, and simulate user interactions while following RTLâ€™s guiding principles.

> Question: What are the differences between unit, integration, and end-to-end testing in a React application? Provide examples of each.
Hint: Explain the scope of each test type and tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

> Question: How do you test a custom hook? Provide an example.
Hint: Use a library like @testing-library/react-hooks or create a test component to render the hook.

> Question: How do you test a component that fetches data from an API?
> Answer: This involves mocking the API call. You can use Jest's mocking capabilities (`jest.fn()` or `jest.spyOn()`) to provide a fake implementation of the fetch request and return predefined data.
>
> Example:
> ```javascript
> import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
> import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
> 
> // Mock the fetch function
> global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
>   Promise.resolve({
>     json: () => Promise.resolve({ message: 'Success!' }),
>   })
> );
> 
> test('fetches and displays data', async () => {
>   render(<MyComponent />);
> 
>   // Wait for the component to update with the fetched data
>   await waitFor(() => {
>     expect(screen.getByText('Success!')).toBeInTheDocument();
>   });
> });
> ```

> Question: How do you test event handlers, like a button click?
> Answer: You can simulate user interactions using `fireEvent` or `userEvent` from React Testing Library and then assert that the expected change in the component's state or the DOM has occurred.
>
> Example:
> ```javascript
> import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
> import Button from './Button';
> 
> test('calls onClick prop when clicked', () => {
>   const handleClick = jest.fn();
>   render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>);
> 
>   fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/click me/i));
> 
>   expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
> });
> ```

> Question: What are snapshot tests and when are they useful?
> Answer: Snapshot tests capture a "snapshot" of a component's rendered output and compare it to a previously saved snapshot. They are useful for ensuring that UI changes are intentional and not accidental regressions.
>
> Example:
> ```javascript
> import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
> import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
> 
> test('renders correctly', () => {
>   const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
>   expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
> });
> ```
