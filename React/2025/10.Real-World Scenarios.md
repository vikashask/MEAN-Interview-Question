> Scenario: Youâ€™re tasked with optimizing a large form with dozens of inputs that re-renders on every keystroke. How would you approach this?
Hint: Suggest using controlled components with debouncing, useMemo for expensive computations, splitting the form, or libraries like Formik` for optimization.

> Scenario: A React application is experiencing memory leaks when components unmount frequently. How would you diagnose and fix this?
Hint: Discuss common causes (e.g., useEffect without cleanup, subscriptions), and how to use tools like React DevTools and browser profilers.

> Question: You need to implement a feature where users can undo/redo changes in a text editor built with React. How would you design it?
