## How to unmount component in react hook

```
useEffect(() => {
	//your code goes here
    return () => {
      //your cleanup code codes here
    };
},[]);

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', () => {});

  // returned function will be called on component unmount
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', () => {})
  }
}, [])

```

### React Core Concepts
> Question: Explain the reconciliation process in React and how the Virtual DOM contributes to it.
Hint: Focus on how React compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM, the diffing algorithm, and how React minimizes DOM updates for performance.

> Question: What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components? When would you use each?
Hint: Discuss form inputs, state management, and scenarios where uncontrolled components (e.g., ref) might be preferred, like integrating with non-React libraries.

>Question: How does React handle event delegation, and why is it beneficial?
Hint: Explain how React attaches event listeners at the root level and the performance benefits of this approach.

> âš¡ Asynchronous
	â€¢	Code runs without blocking the rest of the program.
	â€¢	Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await.
	â€¢	Non-blocking: Lets other code run while waiting for long tasks (like API calls) to complete.

> ðŸ§µ Synchronous
	â€¢	Code runs line by line, in order.
	â€¢	Each step waits for the previous one to complete.
	â€¢	Blocking: Long operations (like fetching data) will freeze the execution until theyâ€™re done.
