## How to unmount component in react hook

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  //your code goes here
  return () => {
    //your cleanup code codes here
  };
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", () => {});

  // returned function will be called on component unmount
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("mousemove", () => {});
  };
}, []);
```

## React Core Concepts

### Question: Explain the reconciliation process in React and how the Virtual DOM contributes to it.

**Answer:**

React's reconciliation process is how React updates the DOM efficiently when there are changes to a component's state or props. Here's how it works:

1. **Virtual DOM Creation**: When your React app renders, it first creates a lightweight representation of the DOM called the "Virtual DOM." This is essentially a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM but is much faster to manipulate.

2. **Diffing Algorithm**: When state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree. It then runs a **"diffing" algorithm** (also called **reconciliation**) that compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.

3. **Identifying Changes**: React efficiently determines what exactly has changed by:

   - Comparing elements of the same type
   - Using keys to track list items
   - Applying heuristics to minimize comparisons

4. **Batch Updates**: React collects all the necessary DOM updates and performs them in a single batch operation.

5. **Selective Updating**: Instead of rebuilding the entire DOM (which would be slow), React only updates the parts that actually changed.

**How Virtual DOM Makes This Efficient:**

- **Less Expensive Operations**: Manipulating the Virtual DOM is much faster than directly manipulating the browser's DOM.
- **Batching**: Changes are batched together to reduce expensive DOM operations.
- **Minimized Repaints**: By identifying exactly what changed, React minimizes browser repaints and reflows.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: The Virtual DOM abstraction enables React to work across different rendering environments (web, mobile, etc.).

**Example of Reconciliation:**

```jsx
// Initial render
<div>
  <p>Hello</p>
</div>

// After state change
<div>
  <p>Hello</p>
  <p>World</p>
</div>
```

In this example, React would only add the new `<p>World</p>` element to the DOM, rather than recreating the entire structure.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Performance**: Only the necessary DOM manipulations occur, making updates fast and efficient.
2. **Developer Experience**: You can write code as if the entire page rerenders on each change, while React handles the optimization.
3. **Declarative API**: Developers describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the "how" of updating the DOM.

### Question: What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components? When would you use each?

**Answer:**

**Controlled Components:**

- Form elements (like inputs, checkboxes) are controlled by React state
- The value of the element is set by React props
- Changes to the element trigger state updates via event handlers
- React is the "single source of truth" for the component's value

```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

**Uncontrolled Components:**

- Form elements maintain their own internal state
- Values are accessed using refs instead of props
- React doesn't control the value after initial render
- The DOM itself is the "source of truth"

```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleSubmit() {
    console.log("Input value:", inputRef.current.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} defaultValue="Initial value" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**When to use each:**

Use **Controlled Components** when:

- You need to validate input as it's entered
- You want to conditionally disable the submit button
- You need to enforce specific input formats
- You need to instantly respond to input changes (like filtering a list)

Use **Uncontrolled Components** when:

- You're integrating with non-React code or libraries
- You're dealing with file inputs
- You only care about the final value on submit
- You want to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- You're building a simple form with minimal validation needs

### Question: How does React handle event delegation, and why is it beneficial?

**Answer:**

**How React handles event delegation:**

1. Instead of attaching event listeners directly to each DOM element, React attaches a single event listener for each event type (click, change, etc.) at the root level of the application (document level).

2. When an event occurs, the browser bubbles it up to the root, where React's single event listener catches it.

3. React then determines which component triggered the event and calls the appropriate event handler function using its synthetic event system.

4. React also creates a "synthetic event" object that works consistently across different browsers.

```jsx
// What you write
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;

// What React effectively does (simplified)
document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches("button")) {
    // Call the appropriate handler with a synthetic event
    handleClick(syntheticEvent);
  }
});
```

**Benefits of this approach:**

1. **Performance**: Attaching hundreds or thousands of individual event listeners would use more memory and be less efficient.

2. **Dynamic Content**: Event handlers work even for elements added or removed after the initial page load.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Fewer actual DOM listeners means less memory usage.

4. **Clean Unmounting**: No need to manually remove listeners when components unmount.

5. **Cross-browser Consistency**: React's synthetic events provide consistent behavior across all browsers.

6. **Event Pooling**: React reuses event objects for performance optimization (before React 17).

7. **Automatic Cleanup**: When a component unmounts, you don't need to manually remove event listeners.

> âš¡ Asynchronous

    â€¢	Code runs without blocking the rest of the program.
    â€¢	Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await.
    â€¢	Non-blocking: Lets other code run while waiting for long tasks (like API calls) to complete.

> ðŸ§µ Synchronous

    â€¢	Code runs line by line, in order.
    â€¢	Each step waits for the previous one to complete.
    â€¢	Blocking: Long operations (like fetching data) will freeze the execution until they're done.
