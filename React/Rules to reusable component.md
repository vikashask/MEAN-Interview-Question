# Rules to reusable component

> 1. Components should be small and easy to read.
> 2. Use prop-types package to structure and validate the props of your components.
> 3. For styled components, do not include any functional details, instead pass them as props.
> 4. For container components, do not include UI details, instead let the children styled components take care of them
> 5. Prefer functional components vs class-based components.
> 6. Prefer CSS in JS strategy for styled components for better maintainability.
> 7. UI variations should be coming in as configurable props whereas data should be coming up as part of global state >ke Redux or React Context.
> 8. Donâ€™t repeat sections wherever it can be avoided, instead use arrays to store those section details and loop over >em.
> 9. For components, add comments only wherever absolutely necessary (to indicate a hack or workaround for a bug).
> 10. For library utilities (pure functions), write JS-Doc comments.
> 11. Avoid using anonymous component wherever possible.
> 12. All files for a component should be part of the same folder.
> 13. Always use eslint and prettier for keeping your code clean and formatted.
> 14. Use ES6 features.
