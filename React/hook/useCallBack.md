## React's useCallback Hook can be used to optimize the rendering behavior of your React function components

## Note: Don't mistake React's useCallback Hook with React's useMemo Hook. While useCallback is used to memoize functions, useMemo is used to memoize values.

## useCallback is used to memoize functions, React memo is used to wrap React components to prevent re-renderings.

! example here : https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usecallback-hook

- React.memo to turn it into a memoized component.
- This will force React to never re-render it, unless some of its properties change.
- In other words useMemo caches a computed value. This is usefull when the computation requires significant resources and we donâ€™t want to repeat it on every re-render, as in this example:

  const [c, setC] = useState(0);
  // This value will not be recomputed between re-renders
  // unless the value of c changes
  const sinOfC: number = useMemo(() => Math.sin(c) , [c])
