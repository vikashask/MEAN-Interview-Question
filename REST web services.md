## SOAP vs REST Web Services Comparison

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
* SOAP is acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol
* Web services and client are tightly coupled with contract
* Learning curve is hard, requires understanding of WSDL generation, client stubs creation etc.
* Supports XML data format only
* Can be tested through programs or software such as Soap UI

### REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
* REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer
* Web services are loosely coupled
* Learning curve is simple, POJO classes can be generated easily and works on simple HTTP methods
* Supports multiple data formats such as XML, JSON, image etc.
