# How Node.js Works – Detailed Explanation with Architecture

Node.js is a **runtime environment** built on **Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine**, enabling JavaScript to run outside the browser — on the server side.

## 🚀 Node.js Flow – Step-by-Step

1. **Client Request**:

   - A user (client) makes a request, e.g., an HTTP request to your Node.js server.

2. **Event Loop Activation**:

   - The request is sent to the **Event Loop**, a core part of Node.js that handles all asynchronous operations.

3. **Thread Pool (libuv)**:

   - If the request involves blocking operations (e.g., file I/O, database query), the **libuv thread pool** picks it up.

4. **Callback Queue**:

   - Once the blocking task completes, the callback is sent to the **callback queue**.

5. **Back to Event Loop**:

   - The Event Loop checks the queue and pushes the completed task’s callback to the main thread for execution.

6. **Response Sent**:
   - The server sends back the response to the client without blocking the main thread.

## 🧠 Summary of Core Components

| Component      | Role                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| V8 Engine      | Compiles and executes JavaScript          |
| Event Loop     | Manages all asynchronous operations       |
| libuv          | Handles thread pool, file system, and I/O |
| Callback Queue | Stores completed asynchronous operations  |
| APIs           | Provides interfaces like fs, http, etc.   |

## 🧵 Thread Pool Explained

Node.js is **single-threaded**, but heavy operations are offloaded to a **libuv-managed thread pool** (typically 4 threads by default), ensuring the main thread stays non-blocking.
