# UI Requirements

## Rate yourself in below skills 
### (Rating should be more than 2.5 in all except GIT)

* JavaScript
* ES6
* Angular
* HTML
* CSS
* GIT/Code deployment

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.

Example:
```json
{
    "name": "vikask",
    "key": "value"
}
```

## HTTP Methods
* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

## Promises
Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous calls. They have two states:
* Resolve
* Reject

Example:
```javascript
promise1
    .then((message) => {
        // do this on resolve()
    })
    .catch((message) => {
        // do this on reject()
    });
```

## Callbacks
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing.

## Closures
A closure in JavaScript is an inner function that has access to its outer function's scope, even after the outer function has returned control. Key points:
* JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions (function inside function)
* Makes properties private
* Closure makes the variables of the inner function accessible

## Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is a mechanism where an event triggered on a nested element will "bubble up" through its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy.

## Arrow Functions
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional functions:
* Shorter syntax than regular functions
* Lexical scope binding
* Similar to regular functions but with concise syntax

Example:
```javascript
() => { statements }
```

## Hoisting in JavaScript
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
